# Multimodal AI Essentials

Welcome to the "[Multimodal AI Essentials](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/multimodal-ai-essentials/0642572002285)" code repository! In this repo, we will learn how multimodal AI merges text, image, and audio for smarter models.

Much of the code in these sessions will be featured in the 2nd edition of [my latest book on LLMs](https://www.amazon.com/quick-start-guide-language-models/dp/0138199191):

## Prerequisites


- Intermediate - Advanced Python Skills: Comfort with Python is crucial as we'll be using it throughout the course to interact with Hugging Face tools and integrate NLP into practical examples.

- Foundational Machine Learning Knowledge: You should have an understanding of core machine learning principles, as weâ€™ll build upon these concepts when exploring advanced NLP techniques.nologies in dynamic and evolving data environments.
